#Description from jupyter notebook and others


##Data in each row consists of three things. row[0]=label, row[1]= pixels, row[2]= Usage

#Row last value is either Training, PublicTest or PrivateTest. Based on that three seperate lists

#Create a temp list where we take row[1] or pixels and make a list of pixels with .split() and row[0] is used for 
#corresponding labels
